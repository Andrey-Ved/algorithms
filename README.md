Data Structures and Algorithms

(python, [networkx](https://networkx.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/))

Based on the course of Timofey Hiryanov

- find gcd (finding the greatest common divisor by division),
- checking for prime,
- recurrent sorting (merge sorting, Tony Hoare sorting),
- invert part of list,
- binary search (defining boundaries in a pre-sorted list),
- grasshopper (dynamic programming example),
- longest common subsequence,
- kmp search (finding position of substring in string),
- check braces (checks the correctness of the parenthesis sequence),
- fibonacci number with caching,
- knapsack problem,
- linked list,
- heap sort,
- hash table, 
- elections results (counting results with using  dict),
- print graph (utility for graph visualization),
- adjacency matrix,
- adjacency list (depth-first search),
- chess knight (breadth-first search),
- dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm with O(N**2)),
- self-balancing binary tree (implementation of strange tree)).
